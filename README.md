# ai-qa-automation-playwright
This project is an AI-powered QA automation framework built using Playwright and Node.js to automate testing of web applications and REST APIs. The framework integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance test validation, failure analysis, and automated reporting, making QA processes more intelligent and efficient. 

## Overview
This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept QA automation approach where
Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into test workflows to improve
failure analysis and debugging.

The goal is to showcase how AI can assist QA engineers by generating
human-readable explanations, identifying root causes, and suggesting fixes
when automation tests fail.

## Key Highlights
- JavaScript-based QA automation design
- AI/LLM-powered test failure analysis
- Prompt engineering for intelligent debugging
- Clean and modular automation structure

## AI Usage
The project uses an LLM-inspired helper module that analyzes test failures
based on error messages and test steps. This approach can be extended to
real LLM APIs like OpenAI GPT or Claude for production use.

## Technologies
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- QA Automation Concepts
- LLM Prompt Engineering
- AI-assisted Debugging

## Learning Outcome
- Understanding AI-enhanced QA workflows
- Designing intelligent automation systems
- Exploring practical applications of LLMs in testing
